This is a multi-label hate speech detection tool designed to identify and categorize hateful content across multiple dimensions: age, gender, physical appearance, race, religion, politics, and others. It integrates two hybrid models: **SGD + rule-based** and **SVM + rule-based**, combining machine learning with expert-defined linguistic rules for more accurate and interpretable classification.
